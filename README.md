# Advent Of Code 2022
Tis the season.

[^1]: Under my personal rules for this, input must read from a file called "day\*.txt". Golfs can do one or both parts, which will be specified with the filename. If a golf computes both solutions, they can be printed either space-separated or on their own lines. Do not assume any properties of your input that aren't specified in the problem description (e.g. length of the input). Byte/Character counts come from `wc -cm`, and files have LF line endings. Wait is the plural of "Golf" "Golves"?


## Visualizers
I wasn't going to do them this year but ALAS

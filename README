# Advent Of Code 2022
Tis the season.

## Golfs[^1]:
- Day 1 (Combined): [103 bytes](day1/day1golf.py)
- Day 2 (Combined): [115 bytes](day2/day2golf.py)
- Day 3 (Combined): [237 bytes](day3/day3golf.py)

[^1]: Under my personal rules for this, input must read from a file called "day\*.txt". Golfs can do one or both parts, which will be specified with the filename. Byte/Character counts come from `wc -cm`, and files have LF line endings
